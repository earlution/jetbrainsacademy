/**
 * A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the 
 * number of people that want to go on a tour, the tour company decided to 
 * increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N 
 * centimeters.
 * 
 * But the tourâ€™s route runs under a lot of bridges, and there is a chance 
 * that the bus will crash into one of these bridges. Can you find out if 
 * this will happen?
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and the number 
 * of bridges under which the bus passes. The second line contains the 
 * heights of these bridges.
 * 
 * You should output 
 * "Will not crash" 
 * if everything will be all right;  * otherwise, output 
 * "Will crash on bridge i" (where i is a number of a bridge) 
 * into which the bus will crash. If the height of a bridge equals the height 
 * of the bus, the bus will crash.
